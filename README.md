# Sea Level Rise Analysis

## This project analyzes sea level changes over time using data from the epa-sea-level.csv dataset. It generates a plot showing the trend of sea level rise with two lines of best fit: one for the entire dataset and another focusing on recent years.

## Project Overview
The project involves:

* Loading sea level data from a CSV file.
* Creating a scatter plot of the data.
* Adding two lines of best fit:
* One for the entire dataset (1880-2050).
* Another for the period from 2000 onwards.
* Customizing the plot with titles, labels, and legends.
* Saving the plot as an image file.
